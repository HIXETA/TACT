TACT does not collect data for advertising purposes.

2. How Your Data Is Used
Information is used only to:
* Enable core messaging and media features
* Provide temporary storage and delivery of messages

3. Message & Media Handling
Some messages or media may be designed to be temporary or non-persistent, depending on the feature being used.
Certain safety or legal obligations may require limited data retention if mandated by law.
TACT aims to minimize data retention wherever possible.
